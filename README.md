# 🌍 iDNS – Research Project on Secure DNS Resolution  

A research-driven exploration into improving DNS resolution reliability and security.  
Developed as part of **AIORI Phase I** under the *India Internet Foundation*.  

---

### ⚙️ Overview
iDNS focuses on understanding and improving:
- DNS cache optimization  
- Query performance  
- DNSSEC validation and integrity  
- Security-focused resolver configuration  

This public repository contains **only conceptual and educational content**.  
All experimental configurations, scripts, and datasets remain private for security and compliance reasons.
