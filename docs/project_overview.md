# ðŸ§© Project Overview

This document summarizes the conceptual and educational aspects of the **iDNS â€“ India DNS Resolver** project.  
The purpose is to understand **recursive DNS resolution**, **cache optimization**, and **DNSSEC validation** from a research perspective.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To explore how DNS resolvers can be optimized for:
- Faster domain name lookups  
- Secure query validation using DNSSEC  
- Efficient cache management to reduce network load  

---

## ðŸ§  Key Research Areas
1. DNS architecture: Client â†’ Recursive Resolver â†’ Root â†’ TLD â†’ Authoritative Server  
2. Cache prefetching and TTL tuning concepts  
3. DNSSEC validation and chain of trust  
4. Performance benchmarking metrics  

---

## ðŸ§© Educational Focus
This repository focuses on the **learning and conceptual framework**.  
Actual implementation, configurations, and datasets used during research are intentionally kept private to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Outcome
- Developed a better understanding of DNS resolver flow  
- Analyzed caching impacts on latency reduction  
- Evaluated DNSSECâ€™s role in ensuring secure lookups
